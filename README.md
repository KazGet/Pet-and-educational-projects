This repository contains my projects where genetic algorithms are used to solve various problems involving ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and partial differential equations (PDEs).

Included projects:

Classical boundary value problems for second-order ODEs (e.g., Sturm–Liouville problem);

Solving the wave equation;

Approximating solutions to the Black–Scholes equation using polynomial representations and coefficient optimization via genetic algorithms.

The goal of these projects is to demonstrate how evolutionary algorithms can be used to find approximate solutions to differential equations, especially when analytic methods are difficult or impossible to apply.

Technologies used:

Python (DEAP, NumPy, Matplotlib, etc.);

Genetic algorithms (selection, mutation, crossover);

Function approximation (Fourier series, polynomials);

Result visualization.
